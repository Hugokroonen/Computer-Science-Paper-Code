This project is about implementing a scalable duplicate search method, using LSH in combination with a clustering approach. 
The code is structured as follows:

The function ProcedureLSHandMSM runs the whole LSH + MSM algorithm 
This function is divided into 5 steps:
STEP0: saving information for evaluation purposes and data cleaning
STEP1: Algorithm for obtaining the binary vectors
STEP2: Algorithm for Minhashing
STEP3: Algorithm for LSH (and needed functions)
STEP4: Algorithm for MSM (and needed functions)
STEP5: Evaluation with Bootstrapping.


he structure of your
code, and how to use the code
